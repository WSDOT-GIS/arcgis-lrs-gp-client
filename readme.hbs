Linear Referencing Geoprocessing Service Client
===============================================

Development Environment
-----------------------
* [Visual Studio 2015]
    * [Web Extension Pack]

LrsGP module
------------
The main module is the `LrsGP` module. These are [UMD] modules that can be used in [Node], [AMD], or browser globals.

### Browser ###

#### AMD ####

See `demo/index.html` for an [AMD] example.

#### Browser global scope ####

If loading via HTML `script` tags, the modules must be loaded in this order.

1. `objectUtils.js`
2. `arcGisRestApiUtils.js`
3. `LinearUnit.js`
3. `EventTableProperties.js`
4. `LrsGPParameters.js`
5. `LrsGP.js`


Unit Tests
----------

There are [Jasmine] tests for both browser and [Node] environments.

* Node tests are in the `spec` folder
* Browser tests are in the `tests` folder. Test is run by opening the `SpecRunner.html` file.

Demo
----

There is a demo application in the `demo` folder.

### What the demo does ###

* A route feature layer is present on the map which is used for snapping.
* User zooms to a location, close enough to make route feature layer visible. Drawing tools will become available once the user has zoomed in close enough.
* User draws either a single point or two points defining a start and an end point.
* The route feature layer is queried for routes at the user specified location.
* If more than one matching route is found, a dialog appears and the user must choose one.
* A geoprocessing service is called to locate the route events.
* When the GP service has completed, the located feature is drawn (if successful).
